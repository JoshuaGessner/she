## `M1-T03` — one hand-built room set, no generation (`DES-015`).
##
## **Hand-built means the layout is authored, not that the geometry is typed by
## hand.** Every room, doorway and post below is an explicit constant; nothing
## is rolled. `DES-015`'s generator is `M4-T01` and is absent here.
##
## The point of building this now, before the generator exists, is that it makes
## two of `DES-015`'s central claims testable a milestone early — and both are
## claims about *shape*, which does not need procedural generation to evaluate:
##
## 1. **The walk out must not be a retrace** (`DES-015` Layer 1). The set is a
##    loop: entrance, two corridors, a junction, back round. If a cycle does not
##    feel better than a dead end at this scale, it will not feel better at
##    three floors, and we would want to know that before spending the
##    ⟨~1-2 months⟩ Layer 1 costs.
## 2. **At least one route bypasses every encounter** (ADR-032, `DES-013`). The
##    west corridor is deliberately empty. That guarantee is asserted by
##    `--route-probe` rather than eyeballed, because it is the rule the whole
##    avoid-combat design rests on.
##
## It also gives the clamor occlusion from ADR-074 its first real test. The gym
## has three ramps and a stub wall; this has corners, doorways and a room you
## cannot hear into, which is what occlusion is actually for.
##
## One Machine is authored (`DES-015` Layer 3): **Guardian & Prize** — a post on
## a prize, in a room with a single entrance, that will never come to you. It is
## the purest form of the M1 gate question: *did the tester choose the fight?*

## The authored layout. Each room is (min_x, max_x, min_z, max_z), and each
## doorway names the two rooms it joins so the loop is legible as data.

	"guardian": [12.0, 22.0, -26.0, -16.0],
	"exit": [-3.0, 3.0, -32.0, -26.0],
}

## (room, side, centre-offset along that side). Sides: n = -Z, s = +Z, e = +X,
## w = -X. Every doorway is cut from both rooms it joins.
const DOORS: Array = [
	["entrance", "n", -7.0], ["west", "s", -7.0],      # entrance ↔ west
	["entrance", "n", 7.0], ["east", "s", 7.0],        # entrance ↔ east
	["west", "n", -9.0], ["junction", "s", -9.0],      # west ↔ junction
	["east", "n", 9.0], ["junction", "s", 9.0],        # east ↔ junction
	["junction", "e", -21.0], ["guardian", "w", -21.0],  # junction ↔ guardian
	["junction", "n", 0.0], ["exit", "s", 0.0],        # junction ↔ exit
]

## All three sit in the east corridor; the west corridor is empty by
## construction, and that is ADR-032's bypass route. The first draft put one in the junction,
## and `--route-probe` failed immediately: every route to the exit crosses the
## junction, so an enemy there means no clean route exists and ADR-032 is
## broken. Caught on the first run of the assertion, which is the argument for
## having written it.
##
## The fix is better than the bug. With the danger confined to one branch, the
## two halves of the loop mean different things — west is long and safe, east is
## short and held — which is the payoff `DES-015` Layer 1 claims a cycle gives
## you, rather than just two ways round.
